### Why use Calcom Docker?
Using Cal.com Docker simplifies the deployment and management of the Cal.com scheduling platform. Here are the key reasons for choosing the Docker approach:  
1. **Easy Setup**: Docker Compose automates the process of setting up the application along with its dependencies, like the database and Prisma Studio.  
2. **Portability**: Docker ensures the application runs consistently across various environments, eliminating compatibility issues.  
3. **Scalability**: Dockerized services can easily scale to meet the needs of small teams or large enterprises.  
4. **Customization**: You can tailor configurations like database URLs, environment variables, and more to match specific requirements.  
5. **Isolation**: Running Cal.com in Docker containers ensures the app and its dependencies donâ€™t interfere with other services on the host machine.  
6. **Community Support**: The [Cal.com Docker repository](https://github.com/calcom/docker) is maintained by the community, providing pre-built images and configurations for a smoother experience.  

Docker Compose makes Cal.com deployment faster, easier, and more reliable, especially for users evaluating the platform or running it with minimal modifications.
